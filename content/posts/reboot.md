In the early 90s, computer animation was still a relatively new technology and had only been used sparingly in television and film. However, that all changed with the premiere of the Canadian animated series Reboot in 1994. The show was created by the animation studio Mainframe Entertainment and was one of the first entirely computer-animated television series.

The series takes place in a computer-generated world called the Mainframe, where the main characters are computer programs. The protagonist, Bob, is a guardian program tasked with protecting the Mainframe from viruses and other threats. Along with his companions, Dot and Enzo, Bob must navigate the digital world and find a way to stop the evil virus Megabyte from taking over the Mainframe.

One of the most striking things about Reboot is its visual style. The animation is entirely computer-generated, which was a first for a television series. The show’s creators were able to create a fully-realized and detailed world that was unlike anything audiences had seen before. The Mainframe is a vibrant and bustling place, filled with unique and colorful characters.

Reboot was also notable for its storytelling. The show was able to explore mature themes such as power struggles and sacrifice, while still being accessible to a younger audience. The series also had a strong sense of humor, with many episodes providing a healthy dose of satire and parody.

The show was well-received by critics and audiences and has since gained a cult following. Reboot helped pave the way for other computer-animated television series and films, and its influence can still be seen in animated shows and movies today.

If you’re a fan of geek culture, then Reboot is definitely a series worth checking out. The show’s blend of cutting-edge animation and engaging storytelling make it a true classic in the realm of animated sci-fi. So, dust off those old VHS tapes or stream it online, and experience the Mainframe once again.
