The first season of Torchwood, a spin-off from the popular British science fiction series Doctor Who, premiered on BBC Three in 2006. The show followed the adventures of a team of alien hunters and investigators known as Torchwood, who operate outside the government and police. The team is led by Captain Jack Harkness, an immortal former Time Agent, and includes other characters such as Gwen Cooper and Owen Harper.

The first season, titled “Everything Changes,” consists of 13 episodes and explores the consequences of alien encounters in a more adult and darker tone than its parent show. This season sets the stage for the series, introducing the main characters and their backstories, as well as the overall premise of the show.

The series was created by Russell T Davies, who also served as the showrunner for the first season. The show was praised for its unique blend of science fiction, action, and drama, and its diverse and complex characters. The performances of John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness and Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper were particularly praised.

One of the standout episodes of the first season is “Day One,” which explores the aftermath of an alien invasion and the impact it has on the characters. The episode also introduced the recurring theme of the consequences of Torchwood’s actions and the moral dilemmas the team faces. Another notable episode is “Countrycide,” which features a unique take on the classic sci-fi trope of the alien invasion, as it takes place in a remote Welsh village.

The first season of Torchwood received generally positive reviews and helped establish the series as a cult hit. The show’s unique blend of science fiction, action, and drama, as well as its diverse and complex characters, made it stand out from other shows of its time. It’s a must-watch for any fan of the genre and for those who are looking for something different from the usual sci-fi fare.

In conclusion, Torchwood’s first season “Everything Changes” is an excellent introduction to the series, with a great balance of action, drama, and science fiction. The first season sets the foundation for the series and establishes the characters, premise and the ongoing theme of the show. It’s definitely worth watching and a perfect show for any sci-fi and fantasy geek out there.
