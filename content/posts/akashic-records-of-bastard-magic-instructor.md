The series was adapted into an anime television series in 2017, and it quickly gained a following among anime fans due to its unique blend of fantasy and comedy elements.

The story is set in a fantasy world where magic is a common occurrence. The main character, Sisti, enrolls in a prestigious magic academy to learn how to harness her own magical abilities. She is excited to start her new journey, but her excitement is quickly dampened by her lazy and unreliable instructor, Glenn Radars. Despite his initial unprofessional behavior, Sisti and her classmates begin to learn valuable lessons about magic and life from him.

As the story progresses, it is revealed that the academy is not just a school for magic, but also a training ground for future government officials and knights to protect their kingdom.

They are constantly faced with challenges that test their abilities and resolve, and it’s exciting to see how they overcome them.

Their interactions are both humorous and heartwarming, and they serve as a reminder that sometimes the best lessons are learned outside of the classroom.

The series also has a strong emphasis on character development, as we see the main characters grow and change throughout the series, both in terms of their magical abilities and personal growth. The relationship between Sisti and Glenn develops in a unique way as well, and it’s interesting to see how they both influence each other’s growth.
