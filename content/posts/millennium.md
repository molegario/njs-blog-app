“Millennium” is a crime-thriller television series that ran for three seasons from 1996 to 1999. The lead actor, Lance Henriksen, is known for his roles in various science fiction and horror films, including the “Alien” franchise and “Pumpkinhead”.

The series follows Frank Black, a former FBI agent with the ability to see into the minds of criminals, as he works for a mysterious organization known as the Millennium Group. The group uses Frank’s unique abilities to solve a variety of brutal and horrifying crimes.

The main characters that appear in the first season include Frank Black, played by Lance Henriksen, his wife Catherine Black and their daughter Jordan Black. The story arc of the first season follows Frank as he uses his abilities to solve a series of brutal murders that seem to be connected to the Millennium Group. The season also explores Frank’s struggle to maintain a normal life for his family while also dealing with the darkness and evil that he encounters in his work.

The effects used in the series effectively portrayed the ethereal experience of Frank’s psychic powers, adding to the overall eerie and unsettling tone of the show. The series also differentiated itself from its sister show “The X-Files” by being more authentically creepy and focusing on the psychological aspects of crime rather than the supernatural.

“Millennium” would appeal to fans of crime-thriller and horror television series, particularly those who enjoy shows that delve into the psychological aspects of crime and the supernatural. The show’s unique premise, strong performances, and effective use of effects make it a must-watch for fans of the genre.
