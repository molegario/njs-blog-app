“Log Horizon” is a Japanese anime series that first aired in 2013. The series is based on a light novel series of the same name and is set in the world of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called Elder Tale. The first season of the anime covers the first arc of the light novel series and follows a group of players who are trapped in the game world after the latest update.

The three main characters of the anime are Shiroe, Naotsugu, and Akatsuki. Shiroe is a strategist and a skilled player who is known for his intelligence and calm demeanor. He is the leader of the group and is determined to find a way to return to the real world. Naotsugu is a tank class character who is known for his strength and loyalty. He is a close friend of Shiroe and acts as his right-hand man. Akatsuki is an assassin class character who is known for her stealth and agility. She is initially aloof and distant, but as the series progresses, she becomes more involved in the group’s activities.

The plot of the first season centers around the group’s attempts to survive in the game world and find a way to return to the real world. The season is divided into several different story arcs, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the game world and the characters’ experiences in it. The first arc, for example, focuses on the group’s attempts to establish a base of operations and build a new society in the game world. The second arc explores the political and social conflicts that arise as the group’s society grows and becomes more complex.

“Log Horizon” was received positively by both critics and audiences. It was praised for its world-building, character development, and complex story. The music, especially the catchy opening song “Database,” was also well-received.

The series is often compared to “Sword Art Online,” another anime series that also features characters trapped in a virtual reality game world. While “Sword Art Online” also explores the concept of players getting trapped in a virtual reality game world, “Log Horizon” is often considered to be superior in terms of its world-building. The series is more true to how MMO culture works and goes much further in exploring the details of the game world and the players’ experiences within it.

In conclusion, “Log Horizon” is an anime that appeals to fans of MMO culture and world-building. It is a fun, deep story with well-developed characters that is far superior to many other anime in its genre. It is a must-watch for anyone who loves MMORPGs and wants to see a true-to-life representation of what it would be like if players were trapped in the game world.
