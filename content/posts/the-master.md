In 1984, the legendary Lee Van Cleef made a foray into the world of martial arts with his action-packed television series, The Master. The show followed the adventures of John Peter McAllister, a former Vietnam War veteran and master martial artist on a quest to find his daughter, who had been kidnapped by a group of terrorists. McAllister traveled around the country, helping people in need and fighting injustice wherever he went. Along the way, he used various martial arts styles, including judo, karate, taekwondo, tai chi chuan, and kickboxing. He also employed a variety of weapons, including swords, staffs, and nunchaku.

While The Master was certainly a formulaic show, it had its own unique charm and is remembered fondly by many fans. One of the most interesting aspects of the show was its depiction of ninjas, which was a relatively new concept to Western audiences at the time. The Master helped to make ninjas cool long before the internet and popular culture were saturated with them.

It’s worth noting that The Master may have played a role in sparking a Western interest in ninjas. According to an article in The Atlantic, the show “was one of the first American productions to introduce ninjutsu to the masses.” The article goes on to note that The Master “helped fuel a fascination with all things ninja that continues to this day.”

The Master was created by Michael Sloan and was executive produced by Stephen J. Cannell. It was an instant hit with viewers, who were captivated by Van Cleef’s portrayal of a real-life martial arts master. The show featured intense fight sequences and exciting storylines. It also showcased a range of martial arts styles, from traditional to more modern techniques. Van Cleef’s character was a master of them all, displaying a knowledge and skill level that was well ahead of the pack. The show ran for just one season but its legacy lives on. It continues to be a must-watch for any fan of martial arts, action, and adventure. With its unique blend of martial arts styles, thrilling storylines, and Lee Van Cleef in the lead role, The Master is a timeless classic that still resonates with fans today.
