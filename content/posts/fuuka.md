The series was later adapted into an anime television series by Diomedéa, which aired in Japan between January and March 2017. The story follows the life of a high school student named Yuu Haruna, who has recently moved to Tokyo and begins to use Twitter. He ends up following a girl named Fuuka Akitsuki, who turns out to be a transfer student in his class, and they begin to form a relationship.

The anime adaptation of Fuuka received mixed reviews, with some praising its portrayal of the struggles of high school relationships, while others criticized its pacing and character development. However, despite the mixed reviews, the anime has a dedicated fanbase who appreciate its realistic and relatable portrayal of teenage romance.
