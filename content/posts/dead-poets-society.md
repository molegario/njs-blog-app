The movie follows the lives of a group of high school boys attending an elite boarding school in the United States, during the late 1950s. It is a story of rebellion, self-discovery, and the power of education to liberate and transform young minds.

The movie follows the story of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a talented young student at the prestigious Welton Academy, and the influence of his English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams).

He leads them to a secret society known as the Dead Poets Society, in which they can meet to explore and express ideas without fear of criticism or punishment.

With Keating’s guidance, the students learn how to think for themselves and how to express their feelings.
